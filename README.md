# FreeMove
Move directories (even from one drive to another) freely without breaking installations or shortcuts

If a program installs on C:\ by default or you want to move the installation folder of a program to somewhere else without breaking it you can use this program.
## How It works
1. The files are moved to the new location
2. A directory junction is created from the old location to the new one. This way trying to access a file from its old location will simply redirect to the new one
## Usage
Just run the executable and use the GUI
